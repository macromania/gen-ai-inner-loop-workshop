# GenAI Inner Loop Workshop - Upskill your search with AI

This workshop is designed to help you understand how to use AI to improve search relevance while Prompt Flow is a tool that helps you build high-quality LLM apps - from prototyping, testing to production deployment and monitoring. The workshop also covers inner loop details regarding environment setup, minimum viable infrastructure, and best practices for building AI-powered search experiences.

You can continue with the workshop by following each section or jump to the section you are interested as implemented and working code. The workshop is divided into the following sections:

## [Part 1: Programming Environment Setup](./part1.md)

This section will guide you through the setup of the python development environment using VSCode and Jupyter notebooks. The section also covers following topics:

- Overview of Python 3 versions and featured offered
- Setting up Python 3.9+ environment using virtual environments
- Setting up Jupyter notebooks
- VSCode extensions for Python development

## [Part 2: Azure Infrastructure Setup](./part2.md)

This section will guide you through the setup of the Azure resources for the code samples and the workshop. The infrastructure setup can be seen as minimum viable infrastructure required for adding AI to your application. The section also covers following topics:

- Setting up Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI
- Azure AI Services Overview
- Deploying Azure resources using Azure Developer CLI

## [Part 3: Developing RAG Pattern using Azure AI Search on Jupyter Notebooks](./part3.md)

This section will guide you through the process of developing RAG patterns using Azure AI Search on Jupyter Notebooks. The section also covers following topics:

- Environment setup for Jupyter notebooks
- Dependencies and packages required for developing RAG patterns
- Connecting to Azure
- Creating Embeddings for RAG patterns
- Indexing Embeddings
- Performing Vector Search
- Creating Chat Completion

## [Part 4: Building LLM Apps using Prompt Flow](./part4.md)

This section will guide you through the basic concepts of Prompt Flow. The section also covers creating and running a simple ChatGPT application:

- Setting up Prompt Flow
- Hello world chat
- Using AI Studio

## Running the Workshop Locally

- **Option 1**: You can create a `workshop` directory and run code samples, exercises, and Jupyter notebooks locally. The workshop directory is ignored. It will give you a good understanding of the workshop and the code samples. You can compare your code with the code samples provided in the workshop.

- **Option 2**: You can follow the [Readme](../README.md) and setup your Azure resources and run the code samples and exercises on Azure.
